# Bristol History Explorer

Bristol History Explorer is designed to help users discover and explore historical sites in Bristol. The website will use the Listed Buildings in Bristol dataset from Bristolâ€™s Open Data platform, which provides detailed information about the city's historic buildings, including their names, locations, architectural details, and grade.

The dataset is publicly available at: [Bristol Open Data - Listed building outline](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/44c7b674edb44e38a48c93162bbfe449_3/explore)
