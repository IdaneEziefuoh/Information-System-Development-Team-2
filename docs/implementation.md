# Implementation

## Introduction
TODO: Describe the system implemented (Describe the dataset. Are there any known issues? Describe any configuration data).
Dataset

The system uses a historical sites dataset, which includes:

Site Name: The official name of the historical site.

Location Coordinates: Latitude and longitude for map rendering.

Grade: Grade of site

Link to external site: Some of the entries provide a link to an external site that gives more information

**Known Issues:**

Large number of entries will make the map very laggy if using markers

Have to use symbols, which is more complicated



## Project Structure
TODO: Provide an outline of the project folder structure and the role of each file within it.
provide a table listing the number of jslint warnings/reports for each module.

index.html -> Contains all the html code, map configuration functions and event listeners.

script.js -> Contains the other functions, such as search, filter, get location.

style.css -> contains the style.

## Software Architecture
TODO: Describe the major components of your architecture. Are any particular architectural styles being used?

TODO: Repeat as necessary

# User guide
TODO: Explain how each use-case works by providing step-by-step screenshots for each use-case. This should be based on a tested scenario.
