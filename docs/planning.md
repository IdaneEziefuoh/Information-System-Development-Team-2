# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
While Bristol is known for its rich historical heritage, many historical sites remain overlooked due to a lack of centralized and easily accessible resources. Currently, locals and tourists struggle to find detailed and curated information about these sites in one place. Existing resources are either outdated, hard to navigate, or do not provide context on lesser-known landmarks. This project addresses the need for a user-friendly web app that consolidates and presents Bristol's historical site data, making it easy to discover and explore the city's hidden historical gems.

### Business benefits
Improved Historical Awareness: The app will increase awareness of Bristol’s lesser-known historical sites, encouraging users to explore beyond popular tourist spots.
Personalized Exploration: By using filters and location-based searches, users can tailor their exploration to match their historical interests, whether focused on specific time periods, architectural styles, or historical figures.
Support for Local Tourism: The app will serve as a tool to promote local tourism, benefiting small businesses and local guides by attracting history enthusiasts.
Increased Engagement Through Gamification: The app’s gamified features, such as user accounts, visit tracking, and achievements, will encourage users to explore more sites and deepen their connection to the city.
Community Building: By allowing users to share their visited sites, progress, and experiences, the app fosters a community of history enthusiasts.
Educational Tool: The app can serve as a resource for students and educators, providing information on historical locations and encouraging interactive learning experiences.

### Options Considered
Existing Apps: Apps like Google Maps and general tourist apps provide information on popular sites but lack a focus on historical context, lesser-known locations specific to Bristol and do not offer gamification elements to engage users.
Guidebooks & Websites: Traditional sources are static and do not provide interactive, location-based features or a way to track site visits.
Custom Development: Building a dedicated app using Bristol’s Open Data allows for a tailored experience that integrates gamification, location-based discovery, and user engagement features.

### Expected Risks
User Engagement: Potential difficulty in attracting a consistent user base if the value of exploring historical sites is not communicated effectively.
Data Quality and Coverage: The dataset from Bristol Open Data may have gaps, outdated information, or inaccuracies that could affect the user experience and site reliability.
Technical Integration: Developing user accounts, visit tracking, and achievement systems may present unforeseen challenges. Challenges in integrating diverse data sources and ensuring the app runs smoothly on various devices and platforms.

## Project Scope
Front-End Development: Create a responsive web interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
User Accounts & Gamification: Implement user login, visit tracking, and achievement badges for exploring new sites.
API Integration: Fetch and display data from the Bristol Open Data API to show site information.
User Testing & Feedback: Gather user feedback to refine features, focusing on the effectiveness of the gamification elements.
