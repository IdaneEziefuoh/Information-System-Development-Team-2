# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
The project aims to address the lack of accessible, centralized data on bus zones and ticket prices in Bristol. Currently, finding accurate and up-to-date information on this topic is challenging for both locals and tourists, which limits their ability to plan affordable, efficient journeys and may discourage public transit use.

### Business benefits
Informed Decision-Making: The app will empower users to make more informed decisions about bus routes, ticket prices, and zone boundaries, leading to improved trip planning.
Improved Accessibility: Users will have a single platform for easy access to crucial public transit data, promoting the use of public transportation by providing clear and up-to-date information.

### Options Considered
Existing Apps: Although several applications provide bus schedules such as First Bus, they often lack local pricing and zone-specific details for Bristol, making it difficult for users to make cost-efficient decisions.
Custom Development: Leveraging Bristol Open Data to build a customized solution allows the app to specifically address the needs of Bristol’s transit users and ensure up-to-date local information on bus zones and ticket prices

### Expected Risks
User Adoption: Users may not immediately recognize the value of the app if it’s not easy to understand or visually engaging, affecting adoption rates.
Data Availability: There is a risk that the Bristol Open Data platform may lack consistent or fully accurate information on bus zones and prices.
Technical Difficulties: Unforeseen challenges may arise when accessing and integrating Bristol’s Open Data APIs into the application.

## Project Scope
Creation of a Simple Web Application Interface: Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build an easy-to-navigate interface for users.
API Integration: Develop API queries to retrieve up-to-date information on Bristol bus zones and ticket pricing.
Data Visualization: Display relevant datasets to help users clearly understand zone boundaries and pricing.
User Testing: Conduct testing with local residents and tourists to gather feedback, refine features, and enhance usability.
