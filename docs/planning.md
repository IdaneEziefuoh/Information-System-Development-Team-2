# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Bristol has a rich history, yet information about its historical sites is often scattered across various sources, making it challenging for locals and tourists to explore the city’s heritage. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use platform that consolidates data on historical locations, making it accessible and engaging for users to discover Bristol’s past.

### Business benefits
Enhanced Exploration: The application will simplify the discovery of historical sites, enhancing the experience for tourists and residents alike.
Increased Engagement: By providing a user-friendly platform, the project can encourage more people to explore Bristol’s historical landmarks.
Educational Resource: The app can serve as a valuable educational tool, helping users learn about the city's history and cultural significance.

### Options Considered
Existing Apps: While there are apps focused on tourism, few specifically cater to discovering historical sites using open data sources, especially in a localized context like Bristol.
Custom Development: Leveraging Bristol's Open Data to create a specialized solution ensures that the app is tailored to the city’s unique historical offerings.

### Expected Risks
User Adoption: The challenge of attracting users who might not initially see the value in a historical site finder.
Data Accuracy: The Bristol Open Data platform may not always have comprehensive or up-to-date information, which could impact the app’s reliability.
Technical Difficulties: Potential issues with integrating and querying the dataset effectively.

## Project Scope
Front-End Development: Building a simple, responsive interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
API Integration: Fetching and displaying data from the Bristol Open Data API.
User Features: Enabling users to search, filter, and explore historical sites.
User Testing & Feedback: Conducting tests to gather insights for feature enhancements.
